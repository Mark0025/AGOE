# AGOE - Age of Empires Learning Project

A ground-up RTS game implementation in C#/Unity, designed as a learning project to master C# development through building a real-time strategy game.

## Project Status

**Planning Phase** - Detailed architecture and sprint planning complete. Ready to begin Sprint 1 implementation.

## Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Unity LTS (2022/2023)
- **Language**: C# 10/11 with .NET 8
- **Patterns**: Command Bus, Event-Driven Architecture, SOLID principles
- **Testing**: Unity Test Framework + NSubstitute

## Learning Goals

- Master C# fundamentals through practical game development
- Apply SOLID principles in a real-world context
- Learn Unity architecture beyond basic tutorials
- Practice test-driven development in game engines

## Development Roadmap

1. **Sprint 1-2**: Core game loop (camera, selection, movement)
2. **Sprint 3**: Economy system (resources, gathering)
3. **Sprint 4**: Production (buildings, units)
4. **Sprint 5**: Combat system
5. **Sprint 6**: Fog of war & exploration
6. **Sprint 7**: Skirmish mode & AI
